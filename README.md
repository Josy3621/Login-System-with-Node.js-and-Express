# Login-System-with-Node.js-and-Express

Description:
This GitHub repository contains a login system implementation using Node.js and Express, with frontend components built using EJS templating and CSS styling. The login system provides user authentication and registration functionalities, allowing users to sign up with a unique username, email, and password, and then securely log in with their credentials.

The frontend interface features a modern design with a responsive layout, allowing users to seamlessly log in or sign up on any device. The system utilizes server-side validation for input fields, ensuring data integrity and security. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with data persistence managed using a database (not included in the repository) for storing user information securely.

Key Features:

**User authentication**: Users can securely sign up with a unique username, email, and password, and log in with their credentials.

**Responsive design**: The frontend interface is designed with a modern and responsive layout, allowing users to access the system from any device.

**Server-side validation**: Input fields are validated on the server-side to ensure data integrity and security.

**Scalable architecture**: The system is built using Node.js and Express, following best practices for maintainable and scalable code.

**Easy to customize**: The frontend components are built using EJS templating and CSS styling, making it easy to customize the look and feel of the system to suit specific requirements.

This login system is suitable for web applications that require user authentication and registration functionalities. It serves as a solid foundation for building secure and scalable login systems in Node.js and Express projects. Feel free to clone and use this repository as a starting point for your own login system implementation. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
